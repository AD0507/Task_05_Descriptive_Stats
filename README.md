# LLM Basketball Statistics Research Project

This project explores how effectively a Large Language Model (LLM) can interpret and reason over structured basketball statistics, using the 2024–2025 Syracuse University Men's Basketball team data. The goal is to evaluate whether an LLM can answer both simple factual questions and more complex, judgment-based coaching decisions—such as identifying the most improved player or optimizing game strategy.

## Objective

- Assess LLM performance in reading, interpreting, and reasoning over tabular statistical data.
- Document the LLM’s success and failure across both straightforward and analytical queries.
- Iteratively refine prompts to improve response quality.
- Reflect on LLM behavior and limitations in sports analytics tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the official 2024–2025 Syracuse University Men's Basketball statistics report (PDF). It includes:
- Full season and conference-only breakdowns
- Player-level statistics (points, rebounds, minutes, etc.)
- Team-level stats
- Game results by date
